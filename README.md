# Train-Schedule
On the backend, this train schedule app hosts arrival and departure data on Firebase and uses Moment.js to retrieve and manipulate this arrival and departure data. On the front end, this app provides up-to-date information about train arrival times and shows the minutes remaining until a train arrives at the next station.
